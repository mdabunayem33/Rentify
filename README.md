## 🚀 Problem It Solves
Traditional property management in Bangladesh often relies on rigid designs, manual paperwork, and offline processes. Rentify addresses these challenges by:
* **Eliminating Manual Tracking:** Automates the scheduling and tracking of rent payments and maintenance requests.
* **Transparency:** Provides real-time visibility into payment history and maintenance status, reducing verbal miscommunications.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces wait times for repairs by allowing landlords to assign technicians and track progress digitally.
* **Digital Literacy:** Encourages a shift from paper-heavy processes to a modern digital workflow.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
The project is built using a modern stack to ensure scalability and responsiveness:
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for database, Authentication for security).
* **Database:** Real-time NoSQL Firestore.
* **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX prototyping.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dual Portal System:** Separate, dedicated dashboards for Landlords and Tenants.
* **Online Rent Payment:** Supports popular local payment methods like bKash and Nagad.
* **Maintenance Management:** Tenants can submit requests; landlords can assign professional technicians and monitor repair status.
* **Announcement System:** Landlords can broadcast important notices (e.g., utility updates) to all tenants instantly.
* **Real-time Analytics:** Landlords can track total occupancy rates, monthly revenue, and pending requests.

## ⚙️ How It Works (System Flow)
1. **User Role:** Users register and login as either a **Tenant** or a **Landlord**.
2. **Tenant Journey:** Tenants view their lease details, pay rent online, and track the status of maintenance requests (Open, In Progress, Completed).
3. **Landlord Journey:** Landlords manage properties, onboard new tenants, assign technicians, and track all payments received.
4. **Data Sync:** All interactions are securely stored in the Firebase cloud and synchronized across all portals in real-time.
