## 🚀 Problem It Solves
[cite_start]Traditional property management in Bangladesh often relies on rigid designs, manual paperwork, and offline processes[cite: 26]. Rentify addresses these challenges by:
* [cite_start]**Eliminating Manual Tracking:** Automates the scheduling and tracking of rent payments and maintenance requests[cite: 452].
* [cite_start]**Transparency:** Provides real-time visibility into payment history and maintenance status, reducing verbal miscommunications[cite: 59, 431].
* [cite_start]**Efficiency:** Reduces wait times for repairs by allowing landlords to assign technicians and track progress digitally[cite: 60, 158].
* [cite_start]**Accessibility:** Replaces bulky paper lease agreements with secure digital storage[cite: 95, 77].

## 🛠 Technical Stack
[cite_start]The project is built using modern web technologies to ensure scalability and responsiveness[cite: 30, 74].
* [cite_start]**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript[cite: 42, 541].
* [cite_start]**Backend as a Service:** Firebase[cite: 42, 543].
* [cite_start]**Database:** Firebase Firestore (for real-time data syncing)[cite: 430, 544].
* [cite_start]**Authentication:** Firebase Authentication[cite: 42, 43].
* [cite_start]**UI/UX Design:** Figma[cite: 545].

## ✨ Key Features
* [cite_start]**Dual Portal System:** Separate, dedicated dashboards for Landlords and Tenants[cite: 71, 519].
* [cite_start]**Online Rent Payment:** Supports popular local methods like bKash and Nagad[cite: 72, 441].
* [cite_start]**Maintenance Management:** Tenants can submit requests; landlords can assign technicians and monitor status (Open, In Progress, Completed)[cite: 73, 158].
* [cite_start]**Announcement System:** Landlords can send instant updates or notices to all tenants[cite: 76, 454].
* [cite_start]**Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices[cite: 74, 521].

## ⚙️ How It Works (System Flow)
1. [cite_start]**User Role:** Users sign up and log in as either a Tenant or a Landlord[cite: 572, 573].
2. [cite_start]**Tenant Journey:** Tenants can view their lease details, pay rent online, and submit maintenance requests if issues arise[cite: 583, 574, 579].
3. [cite_start]**Landlord Journey:** Landlords manage properties, approve/track payments, assign technicians for repairs, and send community announcements[cite: 569, 589, 587, 588].
4. [cite_start]**Data Sync:** All interactions are processed through the Firebase backend and stored in Firestore for real-time updates across portals[cite: 28, 50].
